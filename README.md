## Wythoff's Queen
A simple game in which the player is tasked with defeating an AI. Inspired by Wythoff's Game.

## How to play?
1. Navigate to https://merrickclay.github.io/WythoffsQueen/
2. Click on a highlighted cell to move the queen to that cell.
3. If you move the queen to her castle, you win. If the AI moves the queen to her castle, you lose.

## Rules
1. You may only move the queen to the left, down, or diagonally down and to the left. You can move the queen any number of cells.
2. You and the AI will alternate turns moving the queen. You start.
3. If you move the queen to her castle, you win.
4. If the AI moves the queen to her castle, you lose.

## Features

## Motivation
I wanted to practice developing with React and AWS to further hone my skills. Therefore, I decided to create a simple game I could challenge my friends with. Can you beat the AI?

## Build status
The most recent stable build is hosted at https://merrickclay.github.io/WythoffsQueen/

## Technologies
